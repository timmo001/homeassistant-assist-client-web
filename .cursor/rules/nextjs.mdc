# Next.js

- We are using Next.js 15 app router using create t3 app (https://create.t3.gg/)
- We are using trpc, nextauth, and tailwindcss

## Backend / TRPC

- All backend requests
- Most of the TRPC setup is found at src/server/api
- Routers are defined at src/server/api/routers 

## UI

- We use shadcn/ui components
- We have a dark and light theme using a next-themes provider
- Components are placed in src/components under a directory for each set of components
- All reusable UI components are placed at src/components/ui

## Animation

- Use tailwindcss for simple animations when possible 
- Use motion (formally framer motion) for animations which fall out of tailwindcss animations.
